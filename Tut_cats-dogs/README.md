In this tutorials, serveral interesting methods were includes
1. Queue and multi-threading (thanks to the contribution for @Catdingding)
2. mix the tensorflow and tf.keras
3. Use tqdm to report the progress and performance

4. tensorflow callbacks
  * model checkpoint
  * reduce learning rate
  * earlystopping

5. (TBD) We build up our training handle, which makes us easier to how to programming with tensorflow
