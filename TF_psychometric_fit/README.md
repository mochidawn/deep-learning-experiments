### Tutorial of using Tensorflow fit psychometric function

#### Introduction
In this session, we're going to fit the psychometric function with Tensorflow. <br>
> Generally, a psychometric function is an inferential model applied in detection and discrimination tasks. It models the relationship  between a given feature of a physical stimulus, e.g. velocity, duration, brightness, weight etc., and forced-choice responses of a human test subject. ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometric_function)) <br>
  
The shape of the psychometric function is very similar to (or general format) of the sigmoid function. <br>
