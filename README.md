# deep-learning-experiments
Some experiment stuff and tutorials here.

## Appendix
1. [Deep-learning without frame work](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/DL_without_frameworks) <br>
A tutorial about how to build your neural network without any framework. (only with python!)
2. [Keras vs. TF.keras](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/tf-keras_vs_keras) <br>
After tensorflow included Keras into tf.keras, I use a simple exampe (fizz-and-buzz) to investigate what's the differences between them and how to use it.
3. [Curve fitting - Psychometric function](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/TF_psychometric_fit) <br>
In this tutorial, we used behavioral data colleted from the psychology experiment to fit a psychometric function. Tensorflow is used in this tutorial!
4. [Cat and dog classification](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/Tut_cats-dogs)
Cat/Dog classification task demo.
5. [CNN with simple attention module](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/ImageClassification_with_Attention)

6. [Multi-model and multi-gpus](https://github.com/vashineyu/deep-learning-experiments/tree/master/DL_MultiModel_multiGraph)
This is a very useful tool! If you get many GPUs in one computer/sever, it can help you save time.
